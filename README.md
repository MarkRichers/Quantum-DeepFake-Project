### Idea:
Nowadays, deep learning is the part and parcel of many realtime applications, belonging to the domain of computer vision,
data mining, and natural language processing [1]. Recent
advancements in these methods have been integrated as image
manipulating functionalities in many photo-editing software
such as Adobe Photoshop, Snapchat, etc. Such softwares
enable a naive person to easily edit or synthesize images either
manually or automatically [2]. Moreover, generative adversarial networks (GANs), a category of deep neural models,
are able to generate legitimate natural images without human
involvement [3]. Although such image manipulating softwares
are quite popular among users for entertainment, this may also
result in several serious social and security concerns [4], [5]
like defamation, authentication, impersonation, hate crimes,
frauds, and many others. “DeepFake” [6] is a real-life example
of such an image forgery where the face of a victim was
swapped with the face of the naked person. Moreover, the
determination of such fake images is quite challenging for
humans while deep learning methods have been successful
for the same [7]. However, for good performance, one of
the essential requirements of a deep learning model is the
large training data [8] which is rare in case of manuallycreated fake-face images. In literature, the concept of transfer
learning is utilized in the case of small datasets. Hence, this
paper tackles the problem of manually-created fake-face image
classification with transfer-learning.
